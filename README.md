# Project Title
Twitter Data Pipeline using Airflow
# Description
This is End-To-End Data Engineering Project using Airflow and Python. In this project, we will extract data using Twitter API, use python to transform data, deploy the code on Airflow/EC2 and save the final result on Amazon S3
# Overview of the steps involved
1. Set up Twitter API access:

2. Create a Twitter Developer account and obtain API credentials (API key, API secret key, Access token, and Access token secret).
Set up AWS S3 bucket:

3. Create an S3 bucket on Amazon Web Services (AWS) where you'll store the final data.
Set up Airflow:

4. Install Apache Airflow on your local machine or an EC2 instance. Ensure that you have Python and the necessary dependencies installed.
Define DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) in Airflow:

5. Define the workflow using DAGs. A DAG is a collection of tasks with defined dependencies that Airflow will execute.
Create Twitter API Extraction task:

6. Write a Python script that uses the Twitter API credentials to extract data from Twitter based on specific keywords, hashtags, or user profiles.
Create Python Transformation task:

7. Write a Python script to clean, preprocess, and transform the extracted Twitter data into the desired format.
Set up Airflow/EC2 environment:

8. Configure Airflow/EC2 environment with the required dependencies and access to your Twitter API and AWS credentials.
Deploy Python scripts to Airflow/EC2:

9. Place the extraction and transformation scripts into the appropriate directories on Airflow/EC2.
Create S3 Upload task:

10. Write a Python script to upload the transformed data to the S3 bucket you created earlier.
Define the DAG dependencies:

11. Set up dependencies between tasks in the DAG. For example, the extraction task should run before the transformation task, and the transformation task should run before the S3 upload task.
Schedule the DAG:

12. Define the schedule for the DAG execution (e.g., daily, hourly, etc.).
Test the DAG:

13. Run the DAG and monitor its execution in the Airflow web interface.
Monitor and maintain the pipeline:

14. Monitor the pipeline regularly to ensure its smooth operation. Set up alerting and error-handling mechanisms as needed.
